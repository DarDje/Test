```markdown
This repository includes:
- QA environment setup guide
- Test execution script
- List of required dependencies
- Detailed test strategy
- Test scenarios and test cases
- Guidelines for reviewing automated test results
- Plan for using Patrol or Maestro

## How to Use

1. Read the QA_Environment_Setup.md file to install all necessary tools.
2. Set up the testing environment.
3. Read Test_Strategy.md to understand the testing approach.
4. Use the test-runner.sh script to run tests.
5. Review the Test_Cases.xlsx or Test_Strategy.md file for test cases.
6. Optionally add reports from Patrol/Maestro.
```

### QA\_Environment\_Setup.md

```markdown
# QA Environment Setup Guide

This document describes how to set up the environment for testing a Flutter application.

## 1. Install Flutter SDK

1. Go to the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev
2. Download the latest stable SDK.
3. Unpack the archive to a convenient folder.
4. Add Flutter to the system PATH:

   For MacOS/Linux:
```

export PATH="\$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"

```
For Windows:
- Go to Control Panel → System → Advanced System Settings → Environment Variables.
- Edit the PATH variable and add the path to the `flutter/bin` folder.

5. Verify the installation:
```

flutter doctor

```
Make sure all necessary components are installed.

## 2. Install Android Studio (for Android)

1. Download Android Studio from the official website.
2. Install the program and open it.
3. Use SDK Manager to install all required SDKs and tools.
4. Set up a virtual device (AVD Manager).

## 3. Install Xcode (for iOS)

For Mac users:
1. Install Xcode from the App Store.
2. Launch the iOS simulator.
3. Make sure `flutter doctor` shows that Xcode is installed.

## 4. Install project dependencies

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run:
```

flutter pub get

```
This will install all project dependencies.

## 5. Check connected devices

1. Run:
```

flutter devices

```
You should see a list of connected devices (emulators or real devices).

## 6. Run tests

1. Run:
```

flutter test

```

To automate test execution, use the test-runner.sh script.
```

### Test\_Strategy.md

```markdown
# QA Testing Strategy

This document describes the application testing strategy.

## Objectives

- Ensure the application works consistently for all users.
- Verify all key user flows, the interface, and app state transitions.
- Minimize the risk of errors in new releases.

## Key Elements of the Strategy

### 1. Key User Flows

- Registration and login.
- Main user flows (for example: search, adding to cart, checkout).
- User profile management.
- Push notifications (if applicable).
- Offline mode (if applicable).

### 2. UI Checks

- Conformance to design (colors, fonts, element sizes).
- Responsiveness on different devices.
- Accessibility checks (contrast, keyboard navigation).

### 3. Priority Test Cases

- Smoke tests — check core functions.
- Regression tests — ensure stability after changes.
- Edge cases — test the app with extreme or unexpected inputs.

### 4. Test Data Preparation

- Create users with valid and invalid data.
- Use various device configurations (screen sizes, OS versions).

## Additional: Integration and Widget Tests

- Verify interactions between modules.
- Test Flutter widgets using:
```

flutter test

```
- If needed, integrate tests into CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions).

## Additional: End-to-End Testing (Patrol/Maestro)

- Use Patrol or Maestro to write E2E tests.
- Run tests on emulators or real devices.
- Collect and analyze test reports.

## Reporting

- Use:
```

flutter test --coverage

```
to generate coverage reports.
- For E2E tests, generate JUnit or Allure reports (if possible).

## Guidelines for Reviewing Automated Tests

- Check test results in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Analyze stack traces and logs for failed tests.
- If needed, manually test the feature to confirm the issue.
```


### test-runner.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to run tests

echo "Getting list of connected devices..."
flutter devices

echo "Running tests..."
flutter test --coverage

echo "Generating coverage report..."
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

echo "Report created in coverage/html/index.html"
```

### requirements

```text
Flutter SDK >= 3.0.0
Android Studio (for Android)
Xcode (for iOS)
Patrol >= 3.0.0 (for E2E tests)
Maestro >= 1.0.0 (optional)
```

### Test\_Cases

Create an Excel file with the following table:

| ID  | Test Name             | Description                                   | Priority | Test Data          | Expected Result              |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| TC1 | New User Registration | Fill in the form and check registration flow  | High     | Email, password    | User successfully registered |
| TC2 | Add Item to Cart      | Add an item and verify it appears in the cart | Medium   | Item name          | Item appears in cart         |
| TC3 | User Login            | Enter login and password, verify login works  | High     | Username, password | User successfully logged in  |
